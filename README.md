# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and SASS/CSS on the client-side, along with Node, Express and MongoDB on the server-side.

Tweeter offers a responsive design that allows the single-page application to flow smoothly between screen resolutions, allowing users to have a similar experience no matter the size of their screen. Features include a toggle, which when clicked brings a form into view and focus, used to compose new tweets and post them into the container, refreshing the form and the tweet container once the post passes validation.
